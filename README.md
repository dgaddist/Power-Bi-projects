In this project, I worked with a dataset containing approximately 9,000 rows, which included details such as discount, unit price, shipping cost, ship date, and more. Utilizing Power BI, I created several visualizations to provide insights into the data. Bar Chart: Displays the sum of sales and sum of tax by region. Line and Stacked Column Chart: Shows the sum of profit and sum of discount by customer segment, illustrating the relationship between these metrics. Scatter Chart: Highlights the sum of profit and sum of discount by year and product category, allowing for analysis of trends over time and across different product lines. These visualizations effectively communicate key performance indicators and trends, providing valuable insights for decision-making.
